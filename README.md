# ![HGX](https://github.com/hg-runs/hgx/blob/main/HGX.png)
Used for beta testing (and likely for distribution as well)

## Installation
* Download zip file ([HGX-2.8.6.2-Arcane-Fletchings.zip](https://github.com/hg-runs/hgx/blob/main/HGX-2.8.6.2-Arcane-Fletchings.zip))
* Unzip into an empty folder
    + In case you like to test this: Supposed to start as is with no changes - just point HGX to your NWN installation (on the first dialog page)
* Copy the content of your `data` folder of an older 'Limbo edition' over the new one (So you have the areas, statusrules and opponent's character data)
* After pointing HGX to your local NWN installation start playing

## Goals
* Most important: This refreshed HGX should run as good(or bad) like the old one did
* In addition: 'Arcane Fletchings' should be recognized and displayed

## Remarks
I don't remember if anything else has been changed (But I'm pretty sure there is). I might have a look sooner or later

__In any case: Like with the old one.... No data is transferred! The slack interface is still in but not used__

## Issues
Either contact me on discord or create an issue in the repository. Whatever is more convenient for you
